*Political Philosophy* 1 (2): 432–462. 2024. [doi:10.16995/pp.17532](https://doi.org/10.16995/pp.17532)

Argues that both moralism in ethics and political moralism originate from a problematic dualism that transforms the useful distinction between the moral and the non-moral into a rigid divide. As the historical comparison with ancient Greek thought shows, this obscures genuine conflicts of values and fails to adequately address complex political realities such as “dirty hands” situations.
