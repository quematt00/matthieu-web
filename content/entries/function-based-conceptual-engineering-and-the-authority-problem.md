*Mind* 131 (524): 1247–1278. 2022. [doi:10.1093/mind/fzac028](http://doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzac028)

Identifies a central problem for conceptual engineering—the problem of establishing the authority of engineered concepts—and argues that this problem cannot generally be solved by appealing to increased precision, consistency, or other theoretical virtues. Solving the problem requires engineering to take a functional turn and attend to the functions of concepts. This also helps us alleviate Strawsonian worries about changes of topic.
