    <p class="lede">
      I’m a Privatdozent at the University of Bern and an Ambizione Fellow of the Swiss National Science Foundation. Before that, I spent three years at Oxford, where I was a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College and a member of the Faculty of Philosophy. As of 2027, I will hold an <a href="https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/234746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SNSF Professorship (Starting Grant)</a> and lead a five-year project on artificial cognition.

    I work on the origin and value of some of the most fundamental concepts that structure our thought, such as truth, knowledge, understanding, voluntariness, and liberty. I am particularly interested in how to reconcile the genealogy with the phenomenology of thought, and on what basis to evaluate and extend our ways of thinking in the face of social and technological changes. I like to address these questions by drawing together resources from theoretical and practical philosophy, and my work is also deeply informed by the history of philosophy. In 2022, I was awarded the <a href="https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/About-University/Dies-Academicus/Amerbach-Prize.html">Amerbach Prize</a> of the University of Basel and the <a href="http://lauener-foundation.ch/award.php?aktiv=200000">Lauener Prize for Up-and-Coming Philosophers</a>.

    I have organized my articles by whether they would be most of interest to someone coming from theoretical philosophy, practical philosophy, or historical philosophy. To facilitate navigation by themes, I also built a system of tags and a <a href="#search" onclick="(function(){var t=document.getElementById('search-toggle-desktop')||document.getElementById('search-toggle-mobile'); if(t) t.click(); var i=document.getElementById('search-input-desktop')||document.getElementById('search-input-mobile'); if(i) i.focus();})(); return false;">search bar</a>. The full site is available in <a href="/">English</a>, <a href="/fr/">Français</a>, or <a href="/de/">Deutsch</a>. For any session chairs who might be wondering: my last name is pronounced with a silent ‘z’ [&nbspkəˈloː&nbsp].

	        <p class="book-abstract">
	          Why should we accept one definition rather than another? The book develops a framework for judging concepts by the conceptual needs we uncover when we step back from them. It argues that sometimes, vague and even conflicting concepts are exactly what we need, and shows how to distinguish helpful clarification from conceptual gerrymandering.

	        <p class="book-abstract">
	          A study of the “state-of-nature” stories and genealogies that explain why abstract ideas arise in the first place. The book traces this practice from Hume, Rousseau, and Nietzsche to E.J. Craig, Bernard Williams, and Miranda Fricker, showing how genealogy can reverse‑engineer the pressures that make concepts worth having.

        <h3>Bernard Williams on Philosophy and History</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">Edited by Marcel van Ackeren &amp; Matthieu Queloz</p>
        <p class="book-meta">Oxford University Press, 2025</p>
        <p class="book-abstract">
          For Bernard Williams, philosophy and history are deeply connected. He argues that philosophy, unlike science, cannot ignore its own history, and that historical engagement, whether to produce history or philosophy, requires acknowledging the past's difference from the present. Furthermore, systematic philosophy itself requires a historical approach to its concepts. This volume explores these different interconnections through commissioned contributions that critically appraise Williams’s work in the history of philosophy, his historicist turn, and his use of genealogy. The collection uniquely combines substantive discussions of historical figures (from Homer to Wittgenstein) with methodological discussions of how philosophy should use and engage with history.
