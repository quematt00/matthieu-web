Offers a framework for thinking about “the systematicity of thought” that distinguishes four senses of the phrase, defuses the alleged tension between systematicity and connectionism that Fodor and Pylyshyn influentially diagnosed, and identifies a “hard” form of the systematicity challenge that continues to defy connectionist models.
